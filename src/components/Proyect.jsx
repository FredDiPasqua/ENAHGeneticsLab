    <p className="proyect" >Ancient DNA methods to research bio-anthropological and archaeological 
        questions in Mexican anthropology has a long-standing history. 
        However, with the arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies, 
        Mexican anthropologists are at a crossroads due to the rapid transition 
        to paleogenomics that opens the possibility to analyze a considerable 
        number of human biological remains that translate into massive amounts 
        of genomic data at the cost of sampling methods that often involve some 
        degree of destruction and  the loss of information that could be relevant 
        to other anthropological analyses. 
        With this context in mind, we conducted a review of ancient DNA studies 
        done in Mexico taking special emphasis in the particular historical context 
        of Mexico and the worldwide discussions around Ancient DNA sampling, stewardship 
        and dilemmas to develop an ethical framework proposal for ancient DNA studies 
        done with human biological remains in Mexico. This framework proposal can aid 
        the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), which is legally 
        responsible for protecting the human biological remains found in archaeological 
        contexts to develop the necessary protocols, databases, academic expertise, and 
        international collaboration guidelines to deal with paleogenomics studies done in Mexico.  
        This is a privileged moment when previous research and experiences interact to develop an 
        ethical framework that can establish a working relationship between anthropologists and 
        paleo-geneticists around the world and also encourage our students and academics to rise 
        up to the challenges of an ethical exercise of bioanthropology in the 21st century.
